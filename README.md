## Normal Modes at Planetary Scales

This repository provide a highly parallel algorithm to compute the planetary normal modes. 
The elastic gravitational system is discretized via using the Continous Galerkin mixed finite element method. 
A highly parallel Lanczos approach with polynomial filtering is utiilzed for solving 
the resulting generalized eigenvalue problem. 

Self-gravitation and rotation will be included in the future release.
